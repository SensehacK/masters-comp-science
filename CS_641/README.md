## Course Structure

Didn't follow any specific guidelines towards it but tried to keep course folder structure also semantic with assignments and projects so that it would be easily readable and approachable for novice programmers.

## Assets

Most of the assets are created by me and some of the images would be downloaded off the internet. So copyright with respective owners of the brands and trademarks.
I'm not profiting with any of my work so utilized them for educational purposes.

## Setup

### Preferences

My coding workstation setup you can find it on my other repository where I have shared my settings and preferences for each applications I use daily.

### Cheat sheets

All of my coding cheat sheets which I usually refer back and forth as normally I'm terrible at remembering syntax and commands to run for specific environment.

Sometimes due to limited network connectivity, I can't check with the documentation so this is my personal Coding Diary / Cheat sheet maintained by me.
